This template is provided without any warranty and should be modified by the user as per requirement.

To remove the color for hyperlinks set the line 96 in SVNITPhDThesis.cls as "colorlinks=false," from "colorlinks=true,".


The main template file is "PhDThesis-template.tex" which uses the provided class file
"SVNITPhDThesis.cls".

The folder contains may .sty files which are used in the template.

One may use either of the methods for generating the pdf viz. pdflatex of latex->ps->pdf.

Thanks :-)
